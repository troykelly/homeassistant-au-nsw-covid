_Covid cases and vaccination data sourced directly from New South Wales Health_
<img width="467" alt="NSW Health Covid Sensors" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4564803/127804075-05ee9641-ed7b-45f0-98ac-5d833538cb37.png">

Track daily changes in the New South Wales health districts.

Visibility in to cases, vaccinations and sources. Sourced directly from NSW Health.

## Note

This is not affiliated with, nor approved by NSW Health.

Data is sourced by screen scraping - as NSW Health does not provide this information in any other format.

## Installation

1. Using HACS add the repository `https://github.com/troykelly/homeassistant-au-nsw-covid`.
1. Add the integration
1. Restart Home Assistant
1. In `Integrations` add the `NSW Covid` integration
   - In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "NSW Covid"

## Note

This is a screen scraper. That is not allowed in Home Assistant.

There just is no other way to get this data.

### Missing Information

One number that would be great to have is "cases in community" especially in the last 24 hours.

NSW Health does not publish this number. In a press conference, it was stated that the number is too fluid.

If you have a source of extra information that you would like to see - create an issue!

## Usage

This will create a series of sensors with current NSW Health Covid data.

Keep in mind - NSW Health manually updates their website, when they please.
Aunty Gladys does her briefing at 11am, and sometimes the page is not
updated until late in the afternoon.

## Template Sensors

Some numbers are derived from the data. You can calculate these as a template sensor.

### Local Cases (all of NSW)

A calculation of `total cases` - the sum of `interstate` and `overseas`

```yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Covid NSW Last 24 Hours State"
        unit_of_measurement: "case"
        state: >
          {% set total = states('sensor.covid_nsw_last_24_hours_total') | int %}
          {% set overseas = states('sensor.covid_nsw_last_24_hours_overseas_source') | int %}
          {% set interstate = states('sensor.covid_nsw_last_24_hours_interstate_source') | int %}
          {% set out_of_state = (overseas + interstate) %}
          {{ (total - out_of_state) }}
```
