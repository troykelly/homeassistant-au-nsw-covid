# NSW COVID-19 Case & Vacination Data for Home Assistant

Track daily changes in the New South Wales health districts.

Visibility in to cases, vaccinations and sources. Sourced directly from NSW Health.

## Note

This is not affiliated with, nor approved by NSW Health.

Data is sourced by screen scraping - as NSW Health does not provide this information in any other format.

## Installation

1. In `Integrations` add the `NSW Covid` integration
   - In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "NSW Covid"

## Note

This is a screen scraper. That is not allowed in Home Assistant.

There just is no other way to get this data.

## Usage

This will create a series of sensors with current NSW Health Covid data.

Keep in mind - NSW Health manually updates their website, when they please.
Aunty Gladys does her briefing at 11am, and sometimes the page is not
updated until late in the afternoon.
